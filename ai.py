    # "song" / "album" / "playlist": a music item, go get them!
    # "user": go here once you've picked up all music items

    # Too easy for you? Good...

    # Speaking of positions...
    #
    # X and Y coordinates can be confusing.
    # Which way is up and which way is down?
    #
    # Here is an example explaining how coordinates work in
    # Monkey Music Challenge:
    #
    # {
    #   "layout": [["empty", "monkey"]
    #              ["song",  "empty"]]
    #   "position": [0, 1],
    #   ...
    # }
    #
    # The "position" attribute tells you the location of your monkey
    # in the "layout" matrix. In this example, you're at layout[0][1].
    #
    # If you send { "command": "move", "direction": "down", ... }
    # to the server, you'll get back:
    #
    # {
    #   "layout": [["empty", "empty"]
    #              ["song",  "monkey"]]
    #   "position": [1, 1]
    # }
    #
    # If you instead send { "command": "move", "direction": "left", ... }
    # to the server, you'll get back:
    #
    # {
    #   "layout": [["monkey", "empty"]
    #              ["song",   "empty"]]
    #   "position": [0, 0]
    # }
    #
    # So what about picking stuff up then?
    #
    # It's simple!
    #
    # Just stand next to something you want to pick up and move towards it.
    #
    # For example, say our current game state looks like this:
    #
    # {
    #   "layout": [["empty", "empty"]
    #              ["song",  "monkey"]]
    #   "position": [1, 1],
    #   "pickedUp": []
    # }
    #
    # When you send { "command": "move", "direction": "left", ... }
    # to the server, you'll get back:
    #
    #   "layout": [["empty",  "empty"]
    #              ["empty",  "monkey"]]
    #   "position": [1, 1],
    #   "pickedUp": ["song"],
    #   ...
    # }
    #
    # Instead of moving, your monkey successfully picked up the song!
    #
    # Got it? Sweet! This message will self destruct in five seconds...

    # TODO: You may want to do something smarter here
